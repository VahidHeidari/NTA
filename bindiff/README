BINDIFF is a binary diff utility.

This project is a framework for searching and finding record based files and
file formats. If you want to find deferences of two recorded files, you can use
this utility. This framework compares all records in file #1 with all records in
file #2, and writes all defecences into output file.

Until now this utility only compares 2 pcap files and save differences to
another pcap file. There are 2 search engines: CompleteSearch, and ChkSumSearch.

The CompleteSearch is a complete search algorithm. Complete search engine is
very low in speed, so it is suitable for small pcap file.

ChkSumSearch uses 16 bit check sum calculations for hash each packet to compare
faster than complete search, so it can be used in larger pcap files above 4GB
in size!
