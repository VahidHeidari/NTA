BINDIFF is a binary diff utility.

Until now this utility only compares 2 pcap files and save differences to
another pcap file. There are 2 search engines: CompleteSearch, and ChkSumSearch.

The CompleteSearch is a complete search algorithm. Complete search engine is
very low in speed, so it is suitable for small pcap file.

ChkSumSearch uses 16 bit check sum calculations for hash function each packet to
compare faster than complete search, so it can be used in larger pcap files
above 4GB in size!
