paxtor (Packet Extractor) is a pcap packet processor and extractor.

 Future works:
===============
* Add some better packet number parsing, and reading packet numbers from file.
* Add some filtering abilities, based on IP:PORT and other packet routing specs.
* Add some filtering abilities, based on tunneling protocols like PPP, L2TP, GTP, MPLS, and so on.
