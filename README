NTA (Network Traffic Analyser) is contains simple tools for analysing network traffic.

It contains the following projects:

bin2pcap         : This utility makes a pcap file from the given binary file of captured packet.
bindiff          : This utility is a binary diff framework. You can add search and compare engines to implement diff algorithms.
corrupted_packet : This project is used to generating corrupted packets with hard coded scenarios.
paxtor           : This utility extracts packets from a saved pcap.
statistics       : Some scripts to generate statistics of pcap traffic with tshark tool.
tcp              : This project is used to generating TCP flow with hard coded scenarios.

 Future works:
===============
 Add new projects ;)
 Add some text parser for generating corrupted packets, and traffic scenarios.
